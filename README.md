# Pac-Man Game

Welcome to the Pac-Man Game! This project is a simple implementation of the classic arcade game, where you control Pac-Man to collect pellets while avoiding ghosts. 

## Features

- **Responsive Controls**: Play using keyboard arrows or touch controls for mobile devices.
- **Maze Generation**: A procedurally generated maze with random walls and pellet placements.
- **Dynamic Ghost Behavior**: Ghosts can switch between hunting, fleeing, and returning to their nest based on Pac-Man's position.
- **Game Over State**: The game ends if Pac-Man collides with a ghost, and a game over modal is displayed.

## Installation
